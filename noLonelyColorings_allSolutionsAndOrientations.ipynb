    "# NO LONELY COLORINGS: All solutions and orientations\n",
    "In this file we have three sections:  \n",
    "   1. **Main backtracking function:** Cell that includes the main backtracking function and the imports that will be needed in this notebook.  \n",
    "   2. **Obtaining all solutions for all graphs in a file:** Cell that can be used to go through all the files saved in a g6 file, in order to search all the no lonely colorings of the graphs saved. Before using this cell make sure that the variable 'folderPath' is defined as needed.  \n",
    "   3. **Going through all orientations of an specific graph:** Cell that can be used to check an specific graph. We can obtain all the no lonely colorings and, if wanted, we can go through all its orientations. To do so, we have to make sure to update the variable 'g6_string' with the graph6 format of the graph that we want to check. **IMPORTANT:** In addition, if we want to examine the orientations, we will have to save a file named 'orientations.d6' in the same folder containing this notebook."
